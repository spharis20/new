# What is Git?
Git is a version control software, that keeps track of our software/code, it maintains the history and changes of our project. We can also have numerous versions of our code simultaneously.

#Initializing a Git repository
Starting our git repo, to begin maintaining our project's version history.

#Git Commit
A commit is a checkpoint that represents and holds our code at that point in our project's history. We can always revert back to a previous commit to undo any changes. Usually used to store a significant change in our project 

#Git and Github 
Are two different things. Git is a version control software that can be used on your computer, certain text editors/ideas and its what github uses begin the scens to maintain your code. Github is a remote service that holds your git repos.

#Git Branches
A branch is a seperate version of our code, made from a commit on a different brance (usually the main/master branch). Changes on branches don't effect any other branches in our git repo, thet are independent
